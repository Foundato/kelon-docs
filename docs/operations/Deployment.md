# Deployment

Besides using Kelon as Gateway with a proxy like Envoy or as plugin in a Service-Mesh, it can also be deployed standalone and integrated in your existing services with just a few lines of extra code.

## Local

You can find more information on how to run Kelon as a standalone process [here](/core/overview/example/Run-Example/#from-source).

## Kubernetes

Kelon can also be deployed into Kubernetes with only a few configurations which is also available [here](https://github.com/Foundato/kelon-examples/tree/master/kube-mgmt-kelon-example) in our Kelon-Examples repository.
